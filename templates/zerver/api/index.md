# We hear you like APIs...

We have a [well-documented API](/api) that allows you to build
custom integrations, in addition to our [existing integrations](/integrations).
For ease-of-use, we've created a Python module that you can drop in to a
project to start interacting with our API. There is also a
[JavaScript library](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-js) that can be used
either in the browser or in Node.js.

**Don't want to make it yourself?** Zulip [already integrates with lots of services](/integrations).
